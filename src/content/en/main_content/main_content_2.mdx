The Hartmann Biofilter delivers the highest filter performance with little effort. Our biofilter was developed over 25 years ago - with the firm intention of protecting the environment. Since then, the filter and the resulting filter processes have been continuously further developed and thus also meet the highest official requirements. Thanks to our __unique on-site production__, we manufacture large biofilters optimally tailored to our customers right in front of our clients. This way you get an ideal product that does not need to be touched up.

You will find __Hartmann Biofilters__ in Germany, Europe and the neighboring non-European countries and our filters make us a __leading international provider of efficient exhaust air purification technology__. You too can benefit from our know-how.
